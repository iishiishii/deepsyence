To set up the app and install packages using yarn and start the app, you can follow these instructions:

Make sure you have Node.js and Yarn installed on your system.

You will need to have Rust installed. You can get it by visiting https://rustup.rs. This'll also install Cargo, Rust's package/project manager.

Open a terminal or command prompt in the root directory of your app.

Run the following command to install the required packages:

`yarn`

Once the packages are installed, you can start the app by running the following command:

`yarn start`
